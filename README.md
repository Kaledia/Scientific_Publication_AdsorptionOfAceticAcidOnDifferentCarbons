Title: Adsorption of acetic acid on different carbons
ABSTRACT
This study presents a double environmental aspect, on one hand, decline of the cost of the waste water treatment
thanks to a cheap adsorbing, on the other hand, the valuation of coconut shells.
The acetic acid was used as adsorbent because the knowledge of the size of its molecule (21 Å2) allows
characterizing studied carbons.
The model of Langmuir describes well the isotherms of adsorption on the various types of studied carbons.
It stands out in this study that the capacity of adsorption of inactivated carbon grain (CNAG COCO) doubles
practically if this one is reduced in powder. Besides, the inactivated carbon powder (CNAP COCO) and the
activated carbon grain (CAG COCO) have the same capacity of adsorption. So, the specific surfaces of the
CNAP COCO and CAG COCO are identical: SL = 77 m2/g while that of the CNAG is only 32 m2/g.
The use of inactivated carbon powder can be thus recommended to treat waste water opposite the inactivated
grain carbon which isn’t of real interest.
Key words: Acetic acid ; adsorption ; carbon ; Langmuir.
